    <h1>How We Organize in JS</h1>
<p>Two major patterns for organizing code (data and behavior) are used broadly across the JS ecosystem: classes and modules. These patterns are not mutually exclusive; many programs can and do use both. Other programs will stick with just one pattern, or even neither!

In some respects, these patterns are very different. But interestingly, in other ways, they're just different sides of the same coin. Being proficient in JS requires understanding both patterns and where they are appropriate (and not!).</p>    <script src="script.js"></script>
